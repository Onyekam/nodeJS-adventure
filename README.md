# nodeJS-adventure

Everything in this repository is going to be taken / inspired by this book called:
NodeJs 8 - The Right way. 
Written by Jim R. Wilson

I have been wanting to learn NodeJS for some time now, but was not sure how to go about it. A few days into this book made me realize it was a good resource to get started. Instead of just reading passively, I decided to create a repo documenting every code snippet I come across in the book, so as to make the learning process more efficient.
